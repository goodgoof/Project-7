# Neighborhood Map project

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

Most of the commits in this repository correspond to videos in the program.

## Running project in production mode for service worker to cache.

1. Clone the Project - `git clone git@github.com:goodgoof/neighborhood_map.git`
2. Go into the directory where the project now lives - `cd neighborhood_map`
3. Install the dependencies - `npm install`
4. Start the app - `npm start`.The app will automatically open in port 3000. The address bar will look like this localhost:3000

For successful completion of this project I referred to React documentation, Forrest Walker's and Doug Brown's walkthroughs. Besides the walkthroughs I got lot of help from the slack community in fixing bugs. A huge shout out to all those who helped me @Jacolby @Sachin @DrunkenKismet @jamesDbartlett @Juan N besides lot of others who helped all along the way during this incredible journey. Thanks a lot to Brenda and Kelsey for constantly pushing me and encouraging me. Thanks for the study jams and all that Udacity has offered.
