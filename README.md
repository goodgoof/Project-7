## Resources

I have used Google Maps API and Foursquare data for this project.
I referred to React documentation, Udacity React lessons, went through walkthroughs tutorials to understand the project better and youtube videos for map markers w3schools for flexbox css. I got lot of help from the slack community in fixing bugs. Thanks a lot to Brenda and Kelsey for constantly pushing me and encouraging me. Thanks for the study jams and all that Udacity has offered.
